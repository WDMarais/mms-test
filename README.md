# Metal Management Solutions Assessment
This project was developed on Ubuntu 20.04, using Python3.8

For project structure and reproduction, virtualenv was used.
The libraries used are found in requirements.txt
To get started, the following steps are necessary:
- Obtain an installation of virtualenv with `sudo apt install python3.8-venv`
- Obtain the virtualenv module with `python3 -m pip install virtualenv`
- Create your own virtual environment with `python3 -m venv mms-env` (Note that in place of mms-env, you can use whichever name you'd like. If you do make this change though, be sure to replace mms-env with your chosen environment name in all the following contain mms-env as well.)
- Activate the virtual environment with `source mms-env/bin/activate` (If this step was successful, the next line in the terminal session should start with `(mms-env)`)
- Install the necessary modules into your virtual environment by running `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
